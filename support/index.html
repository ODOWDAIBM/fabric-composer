<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

<p>Is this targeted at v0.6 hyperledger?</p>

<h4 id="answer-1">Answer 1</h4>

<p>Right now, we are on v0.6 yes.</p>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>

<p>When can we expect to start using concerto?</p>

<h4 id="answer-2">Answer 2</h4>

<p>It’s still an alpha, but we want to release early, release often and incorporate as much feedback as possible and evolve this thing with you all.</p>

<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>

<p>Can Concerto support hierarchy - for example a manufacturing scenario, where a component is built with multiple parts, many such components go into bigger components and so on. For example, represent a whole car as well as the tiniest chip or bolt that goes in?</p>

<h4 id="answer-3">Answer 3</h4>

<p>Concerto can model classes with relationships to other classes, so I don&#39;t see why not. </p>

<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>

<p>Is the framework a design time only tool, or is it by applications during any transaction invocation, i.e., runtime?</p>

<h3 id="answer-4">Answer 4</h3>

<p>Both design time and runtime</p>

<h3 id="question-5">Question 5</h3>

<p>Is there an outlook on when Fabric v1 will be supported?</p>

<h3 id="answer-5">Answer 5</h3>

<p>We will start the port as soon as Fabric is stable / approaching GA. It’s the usual balance between being on the cutting edge / early validation of the underlying platform and getting stuff done. We have weekly calls with Jim Zhang (@jzhang, <a href="mailto:jzhang@us.ibm.com">jzhang@us.ibm.com</a>) and Gari Singh (@garisingh, <a href="mailto:garis@us.ibm.com">garis@us.ibm.com</a>) so I’m optimistic it won’t take us too long to port Concerto, and the breakage for Concerto users should be small.</p>

<h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>

<p>If you aren&#39;t generating go or java code, how do you ensure that different apps have isolated data? If you had just one set of chaincodes interpreting the application description, wouldn&#39;t all endorsers/validators of that chaincode see data for all apps? How would you allow different endorsers for different apps? Do you have a different instance of the runtime for each time?</p>

<h3 id="answer-6">Answer 6</h3>

<p>There is one instance of the Concerto Go &quot;system&quot; chaincode deployed for each business network (app), so that provides isolation between business networks.</p>

<h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>

<p>One for each business network or one for each app?</p>

<h3 id="answer-7">Answer 7</h3>

<p>Business Network Definition is a Concerto concept — is represents a set of participants that want to exchange assets using transactions. The Business Network Definition is isolated from other deployed Business Network Definitions by deploying it to its own chaincode. We are working on docs/glossary etc. for Playback 1 which will make this stuff much clearer… I hope!</p>

<h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>

<p>Who would be the endorsers for the concerto chaincode(s)?</p>

<h3 id="answer-8">Answer 8</h3>

<p>We will be updating the Concerto API&#39;s to account for the changes involving endorsers in fabric v1</p>

<h3 id="question-9">Question 9</h3>

<p>Will the “early program” be useful for people who choose not to use Concerto? Does this question even make sense?</p>

<h3 id="answer-9">Answer 9</h3>

<p>The early program is really aimed at Concerto.  Now, Concerto layers on top of HL fabric, Concerto works nicely with HSBN already, so it will help you get going with all HL fabric deployments.  What it won&#39;t do is teach you how to write Go chaincode, because the programming model is much simpler.  (see the pinned video at the top of the channel).</p>

<h3 id="question-10">Question 10</h3>

<p>Majority of the BC use cases will be about managing assets and transfers. Use cases like Trade Finance, Logistics, etc., which are about managing records and documents on BC for participating parties and controlling access to these records based on the permission configured for each party and the workflow state, is another class of use cases that can be modelled relatively easily by a simple smart contract program without having support for assets and transfers.  What are your thoughts for such use cases? SC Framework and SCDL is mainly for such use cases.</p>

<h3 id="answer-10">Answer 10</h3>

<p>The early program is really aimed at Concerto.  Now, Concerto layers on top of HL fabric, Concerto works nicely with HSBN already, so it will help you get going with all HL fabric deployments.

<h3 id="question-11">Question 11</h3>

<p>The early program will run on 0.6 but the framework will move to 1.0 as soon as the code is ready. What does this mean to the client given that 1.0 is so different from 0.6?</p>

<h3 id="answer-11">Answer 11</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll be fine. The thing about concerto is that it abstracts away these issues.  Specifically, for endorser/consenter, we&#39;ll change submit transaction from being against the network to being against a counterparty, Business networks map directly to channels, and concerto already has the concept of linked resources, so different networks will be able to link to each other.  Finally, the new database support will make our queries more efficient. Net is that there will be small application changes on the submitTransaction API. The new stuff in V1 is super btw- the endorser consenter model mirrors what happens in the real wold.  For example, in HL 0.x if I want to do (e.g.) a funds transfer someone else in the network, I submit that transaction to the network.  In V1.x, I submit the transaction to my bank and then it makes sure that the transaction is endorsed appropriately - probably by making sure my bank and my counterparties bank agree the transaction.  Very nice indeed.</p>

<h3 id="question-12">Question 12</h3>

<p>Does Concerto generate fully customizable code or are there other ways of extending existing functionality?</p>

<h3 id="answer-12">Answer 12</h3>

<p>Concerto provides a modelling language and a set APIs for the user to develop applications against. We provide a JavaScript client API for building client applications, and a JavaScript runtime API for building transaction processor functions that run inside the Blockchain. You (the user) is fully in control of developing the JavaScript code that calls those APIs. The only code generation we are doing is generation of REST APIs (using Loopback) and generation of development time accelerators such as TypeScript bindings for the model. We&#39;re happy to hear any feedback we can get, and will be waiting for additional feature requests.</p>

<h3 id="question-13">Question 13</h3>

<p>As a chaincode developer I’m curious how you managed to create this, especially without code generation. Does the code run with a different kind of baseimage to enable javascript, or do you interpret the javascript from within a golang or Java chaincode?</p>

<h3 id="answer-13">Answer 13</h3>

<p>We use a JavaScript interpreter written in Go called <a href="https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto">Otto</a> and that handles the execution of our &quot;system&quot; code and the users code. We have developed a Domain Specific Language for Concerto that allows users to model assets, participants, and transactions. That DSL is reasonably simple text that is designed to be easy for developers to hand write, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">asset Field identified by fieldID {
  o String fieldID
  o String name
  --&gt; Business business // a relationship to the owning business
}
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="question-14">Question 14</h3>

<p>Were any thoughts given to using an embedded V8 rather than <a href="https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto">Otto</a>?</p>

<h3 id="answer-14">Answer 14</h3>

<p>We did <em>briefly</em> consider V8, but it would have meant custom bindings to Go. A full-blown Node runtime seems much more interesting. <a href="https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto">Otto</a> allows us to test the programming model at low cost and then allow customers to drive us.</p>

<h3 id="question-15">Question 15</h3>

<p>My understanding is that Concerto facilitates smart contracts in Javascript language on Hyperledger. To achieve this, does it provide some sort of Javascript SDK/APIs for developing smart contracts OR is it open for the developer to write &#39;any&#39; Javascript code using the base language?</p>

<h3 id="answer-15">Answer 15</h3>

<p>The JS you can write is “substantially” open. You can use ES5 syntax, but you cannot ‘require’ external packages. We provide a server-side JS API to interact with asset registries, create assets etc.</p>

<h3 id="question-16">Question 16</h3>

<p>To run Javascript smart contract, is there a separate run time Concerto chaincode for each smart contract; Or is there a single run time Concerto chaincode for all smart contracts?</p>

<h3 id="answer-16">Answer 16</h3>

<p>There is a generic Concerto chaincode (written in Go) that implements the server-side component of Concerto. When you deploy a Business Network Definition (the deployable artefact for Concerto) we also deploy a new copy of the Concerto chaincode. This is a design choice that was driven by our desire to prevent different Business Networks from potentially seeing each other’s world state.</p>

<h3 id="question-17">Question 17</h3>

<p>Is it correct to say that Concerto design is mainly driven to support Assets (and transfers) on blockchain? Can it also support scenarios other than assets and transfers?</p>

<h3 id="answer-17">Answer 17</h3>

<p>The fundamental programming model is: a transaction occurs on behalf of a participant, and this transaction needs to be stored on the BC, and may alter the state of assets that are being tracked in asset registries on the BC. We believe that this programming model is sufficiently general that it can be applied to a very wide range of BC problems. Time will tell!</p>

<h3 id="question-18">Question 18</h3>

<p>What level of chaincode do you touch? Is it mostly JS?</p>

<h3 id="answer-18">Answer 18</h3>

<p>A small Go &quot;container&quot; layer around mostly JavaScript code.</p>

<h3 id="question-19">Question 19</h3>

<p>Is there some JavaScript code that is placed in the chaincode container?  If so, how is it exposed, called, triggered?</p>

<h3 id="answer-19">Answer 19</h3>

<p>The JavaScript code is running in Go by using a JavaScript interpreter for Go.</p>

<h3 id="question-20">Question 20</h3>

<p>Where is the code?</p>

<h3 id="answer-20">Answer 20</h3>

<p>IBM GitHub Enterprise, part of Whitewater tools.</p>

<h3 id="question-21">Question 21</h3>

<p>Where is the code published in npm?</p>

<h3 id="answer-21">Answer 21</h3>

<p>IBM npm Enterprise, part of Whitewater tools.</p>

<h3 id="question-22">Question 22</h3>

<p>Is there a UI to drive the creation of the data model, or is it just editing the text file?</p>

<h3 id="answer-22">Answer 22</h3>

<p>Just editing text files at the moment.</p>

<h3 id="question-23">Question 23</h3>

<p>Are the loopback REST APIs created dynamically based on the data model?</p>

<h3 id="answer-23">Answer 23</h3>

<p>Yes, the Loopback APIs are created dynamically.</p>

<h3 id="question-24">Question 24</h3>

<p>Does the developer enter the text, and the UML view dynamically creates?</p>

<h3 id="answer-24">Answer 24</h3>

<p>Not yet, the UML is only updated when the model is deployed to the Blockchain.</p>

<h3 id="question-25">Question 25</h3>

<p>Is the syntax of the file custom and parsed by Concerto/Composer to break out data model elements and business logic (JS code) based on parsing?</p>

<h3 id="answer-25">Answer 25</h3>

<p>Yes, but we are working on splitting the data model and business logic into separate files.</p>

<h3 id="question-26">Question 26</h3>

<p>I see the business logic JavaScript has syntax highlighting.  How is that implemented?</p>

<h3 id="answer-26">Answer 26</h3>

<p>Using the open source CodeMirror component.</p>

<h3 id="question-27">Question 27</h3>

<p>Will Concerto provide a Java API? Most of what I have seen so far focused on JavaScript.</p>

<h3 id="answer-27">Answer 27</h3>

<p>Once Fabric has a Java equivalent of HFC then we can wrap it and build a Java API around it.</p>
